# Installing Cookie Parser Middleware

Parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names. Optionally you may enable signed cookie support by passing a secret string, which assigns req.secret so it may be used by other middleware.

In the command line, run

```sh
> npm install cookie-parser --save
```
